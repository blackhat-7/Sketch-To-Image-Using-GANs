# Sketch-To-Image-Using-GANs

A Generative Adverserial Network that converts sketches made by artists into real images which look like a real person.
In this study, we as a team have taken up this project to learn how these networks work and implement a Gener- ative Adversarial Network which could create a real life image given the sketch. It could have many use cases, one being, a sketch of a convict when passed through the network would provide with real life matching im- age which could be used by law enforcing agencies.
